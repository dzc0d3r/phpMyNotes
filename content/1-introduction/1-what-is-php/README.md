# What is PHP ?

PHP is a widely used open source general-purpose scripting language, the word PHP is a recursive acronym for `PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor` (The first P stands for PHP itself, H stands for Hypertext, and the last P stands for Preprocessor).
It's a Server Side Scripting languages meaning that it only runs and evaluates on the server side not on the client side (Browsers).
PHP is an Interpreted languages, especially suited for web development and can be embedded into HTML.
Easy to learn and get familiar with its syntax and fonctionalities.

## But what does all of this mean?

In order to understand what we did mention above about PHP, let's take a look to a simple introductory example and examine it .

Create an `index.php` file (it's important to use `.php` extension), Open it your favorite text editor (`Atom`, `vs code` etc), and inside it paste the following code :

```php
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
 <head>
 <title>Example</title>
 </head>
 <body>

 <?php
  echo "Hi, I'm a PHP script!";
 ?>

 </body>
</html>
```

Before we examine the code above, it's worth to mention that there is no way to run this example on your machine without installing PHP first.
Because this is just an introduction to PHP, aiming to explain what is PHP in the first place .. we will not install PHP, nor we will run the `index.php` , for that read ( Getting Started with PHP).
Instead we will simply focus on the code and the syntax, in order to take some key notes.

**So .. Did you notice anything ?**

Instead of lots of commands to output HTML (as seen in C or Perl), or using a templating engine (as seen in Python and Ruby ).
PHP pages contain HTML with embedded php code that does "something" (in this case, output "Hi, I'm a PHP script!").
The PHP code is enclosed in special `<?php` and `?>` tags that allow you to jump into and out of "PHP mode."

PHP code is first executed on the server, generating HTML which is then sent to the client.
The client would receive the results of running the PHP scripts, but would not know what the underlying code was.

The best part about using PHP is that it is extremely simple and easy for a beginner, but also offers many advanced features for a professional programmer.

It's worth to mention that the PHP documentation is well written, maintened and very helpfull for beginners and professinal developers too.
You can always check for something in the language and read about it on [php docs](https://www.php.net)

## Finally

Don't be afraid to learn PHP.
You can jump in, in a short time :

1. Make a lot of coffee.
2. Read about PHP features & learn some new concepts.
3. Write some code & apply what you learned.
4. Experiment with the code .
5. Read more & learn more.
6. Drink more coffee.
7. Write more code & apply what you learned
8. Repeat .
